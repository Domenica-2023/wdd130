    <p>Hi I'm Domenica, I am a BYUI Online student. I am looking to get a WDD Certificate. My hobbies are playing video games, taking a walk with my dog, and exercising. I'm pretty young still so I don't have a job yet. The reason I am taking these classes is to make sure I get into a job focusing on my dream career. My dream is to become a professional Game Designer. The thing I love most about BYUI is how, when I need questions answered my classmates and teachers know how to help me right away. The reason I am taking this course is to further my education on code. I'm sure what ever I learn in this course will be applicable to my future. The advantages I see in learning about careers in web design are that I will enjoy my career and be in the tech industry. When I was 14 I started to go to this church, a year later I was baptized by my Uncle's bestfriend stepdad and after that I tried going to church every Sunday when I wasn't busy with stuff. My favorite scripture is D&C 88:118 which says "And as all have not afaith, seek ye diligently and bteach one another words of cwisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best dbooks words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." </p>
