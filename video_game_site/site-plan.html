        Hi, my name is Domenica and this page is about video game design. It is my dream to become a Video Game Designer one day. This is a website that will help people with the same dream as me to accomplish that. This website will offer community, resources and information for people interested in becoming game designers as well. This website will attempt to answer all your questions. People will learn information by watching videos about what it is like to work in video game design, by reading about the stuff that we do on a daily basis and by getting virtual tours around video game designer offices.  My website will also offer a booking service to book in person tours at offices that allow visitors (prospective future game designers).
